## Experimental Methodology

### Datasets
We evaluate our approach on multiple standard audio processing benchmarks:

1. **Google Speech Commands v0.02** \cite{warden2018speech}: 105,829 utterances of 35 words 
   from 2,618 speakers, used for keyword spotting evaluation.

2. **ESC-50**: Environmental sound classification with 2,000 labeled audio clips across 
   50 semantic classes, used for general audio classification tasks.

3. **Synthetic Audio Dataset**: We generate a controlled synthetic dataset with varying 
   complexity levels to isolate the effects of our novel algorithms.

### Baseline Comparisons
We compare against the following state-of-the-art baselines:
